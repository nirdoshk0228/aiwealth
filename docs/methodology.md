# Methodology

Formulas and conventions used by the deterministic risk engine (`apps/api/app/engine`).
Data handling (alignment, gaps, sources) is described in [data.md](data.md).

## Returns

- Simple daily returns, `r_t = P_t / P_{t-1} - 1`, on the aligned trading calendar
  (`app/engine/returns.py`). Log returns are used only for time aggregation / GBM calibration.
- Annualisation uses 252 trading days.

## Value-at-Risk and CVaR (`app/engine/risk/var.py`)

### Conventions

| Item | Convention |
|---|---|
| Portfolio return | `R_p,t = Σ_i w_i r_i,t`, fixed weights (rebalanced daily) |
| Weights | keyed by asset id, finite, sum to 1 (negative = short; long-only is enforced at the API layer) |
| Loss | `L = -R_p` |
| VaR | positive loss fraction of portfolio value, with confidence level and horizon stated, e.g. "1-day 99% VaR = 2.3%" |
| CVaR | `E[L \| L ≥ VaR]`, same units; always ≥ VaR |
| Sign | not clipped: a negative VaR means a gain even at the chosen quantile |
| Horizon | 1 trading day base; `h`-day = `√h ×` 1-day, `h ≤ 20` |
| Minimum history | 252 observations by default |

`α = 1 − confidence`.

### Historical

Sort the `n` portfolio losses worst-first, `L_(1) ≥ … ≥ L_(n)`, and let `k = ⌈n·α⌉`
(with `n·α` rounded to 9 decimals first, because e.g. `100 × (1 − 0.95) = 5.000000000000004`
in floating point).

    VaR  = L_(k)
    CVaR = (1/k) Σ_{j=1..k} L_(j)

This is the generalised inverse of the empirical CDF (`np.quantile(R, α, method="inverted_cdf")`).
`np.quantile`'s default (`"linear"`) and Excel's `PERCENTILE.INC` interpolate between
neighbouring order statistics and give slightly different values. Requires `n·α ≥ 1`.
With 252 observations a 99% VaR rests on only `k = 3` tail points.

### Parametric (variance-covariance)

    μ_p = wᵀμ̂,   σ_p = √(wᵀΣ̂w)        (sample mean, sample covariance with ddof = 1)
    z   = Φ⁻¹(confidence)              (1.6449 at 95%, 2.3263 at 99%)
    VaR  = z·σ_p − μ_p
    CVaR = σ_p·φ(z)/α − μ_p

Φ⁻¹ and φ come from Python's `statistics.NormalDist`. Assumes normal portfolio returns.

### Monte Carlo

Draw `n_sims` (default 100,000) vectors `X_s ~ N(μ̂, Σ̂)` with
`np.random.default_rng(seed)` (default seed 0, SVD factorisation so singular Σ̂ works),
form `R_s = wᵀX_s`, then apply the historical order-statistic estimator.

For a fixed-weight portfolio `wᵀX` is exactly `N(μ_p, σ_p²)`, so this is the same model as
the parametric method plus sampling noise. It is the base for later non-normal
(e.g. Student-t) or non-linear simulation.

### Horizon scaling

`VaR_h = √h · VaR_1` (same for CVaR) for every method. Exact only for i.i.d. zero-mean normal
returns; it ignores drift (which scales with `h`), volatility clustering, autocorrelation,
the changing shape of fat tails under aggregation, and compounding.
